The set may not fit well into access memory or may require prohibitively long processing. These are significant challenges to skilled software engineers and they can render the standard Jupyter system unusable.\nAs a solution to this problem, Docker for Data Science proposes using Docker. You will learn how to use existing pre-compiled public images created by the major open-source technologies―Python, Jupyter, Postgres―as well as using the Dockerfile to extend these images to suit your specific purposes. The Docker-Compose technology is examined and you will learn how it can be used to build a linked system with Python churning data behind the scenes and Jupyter managing these background tasks.

It’s just a view. The real beauty in React is actually the architectural pattern that handles data in and out of React applications: Flux. With Flux, you’re able to build data-rich applications that engage your users, and scale to meet every demand. It is a key part of the Facebook technology stack that serves billions of users every day.\n\nThis book will start by introducing the Flux pattern and help you get an understanding of what it is and how it works. After this, we’ll build real-world React applications that highlight the power and simplicity of Flux in action. Finally, we look at the landscape of Flux and explore the Alt and Redux libraries that make React and Flux developments easier.\n\nFilled with fully-worked examples and code-first explanations, by the end of the book, you’ll not only have a rock solid understanding of the architecture, but will be ready to implement Flux architecture in anger.\n\nWhat you will learn\n\nUnderstand the Flux pattern and how it will impact your React applications\nBuild real-world applications that rely on Flux\nHandle asynchronous actions in your application\nImplement immutable stores with Immutable.js\nReplace React.js with alternate View components such as jQuery and Handlebars\nTest and benchmark your Flux architecture using Jest―Facebook’s enhancement of the Jasmine library",

    "description": "Book Description:\n\nConcurrency programming allows several large tasks to be divided into smaller sub-tasks, which are further processed as individual tasks that run in parallel. All the sub-tasks are combined together once the required results are achieved; they are then merged to get the final output. The whole process is very complex. This process goes from the design of concurrent algorithms to the testing phase where concurrent applications need extra attention. Java includes a comprehensive API with a lot of ready-to-use components to implement powerful concurrency applications in an easy way, but with a high flexibility to adapt these components to your needs.\n\nThe book starts with a full description of design principles of concurrent applications and how to parallelize a sequential algorithm. We’ll show you how to use all the components of the Java Concurrency API from basics to the most advanced techniques to implement them in powerful concurrency applications in Java.\n\nYou will be using real-world examples of complex algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, image processing in client / server environments. Next, you will learn how to use the most important components of the Java 8 Concurrency API: the Executor framework to execute multiple tasks in your applications, the phaser class to implement concurrent tasks divided into phases, and the Fork/Join framework to implement concurrent tasks that can be split into smaller problems (using the divide and conquer technique). Toward the end, we will cover the new inclusions in Java 8 API, the Map and Reduce model, and the Map and Collect model. The book will also teach you about the data structures and synchronization utilities to avoid data-race conditions and other critical problems. Finally, the book ends with a detailed description of the tools and techniques that you can use to test a Java concurrent application.\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nIf you are a competent Java developer with a good understanding of concurrency but have no knowledge of how to effectively implement concurrent programs or use streams to make processes more efficient, then this book is for you.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nDesign concurrent applications by converting a sequential algorithm into a concurrent one\nDiscover how to avoid all the possible problems you can get in concurrent algorithms\nUse the Executor framework to manage concurrent tasks without creating threads\nExtend and modify Executors to adapt their behavior to your needs\nSolve problems using the divide and conquer technique and the Fork/Join framework\nProcess massive data sets with parallel streams and Map/Reduce implementation\nControl data-race conditions using concurrent data structures and synchronization mechanisms\nTest and monitor concurrent applications",

After building the data application layer using Entity Framework Core and a RESTful service using ASP.NET Core, you will then build the client side web application three ways: first, using ASP.NET Core, then using Angular 2, and, finally, using React.  You will be able to compare and contrast these UI frameworks and select the best one for your needs.\n\n.NET Core is a complete rewrite of the popular .NET and its related frameworks. While many concepts are similar between .NET Core and the .NET 4.6 framework, there are revolutionary changes as well, including updates to Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core. The first section of this book covers the three main parts of building applications with C#: Entity Framework, ASP.NET Core Services, and ASP.NET Core Web Applications.\n\nThere is also an explosion in popularity of JavaScript frameworks for client side development, and the authors cover two of the most popular UI frameworks. Start with TypeScript for developing clean JavaScript, along with a client side build tool such as Gulp, Grunt, and WebPack. Using the same data access layer and RESTful service from the .NET Core application, you can rebuild the UI using Angular 2. Then, repeat the process using React, for a true comparison of building client side applications using ASP.NET Core, Angular 2, and React.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nUnderstand the fundamentals of .NET Core and what that means to the traditional .NET developer\nBuild a data access layer with Entity Framework Core, a RESTful service with ASP.NET Core MVC, and a website with ASP.NET Core MVC and Bootstrap\nAutomate many build tasks with client side build utilities\nWho This Book Is For\nIntermediate to advanced .NET developers",

This is not a book about theory, good intentions or possible future developments. You’ll benefit from translation technology and solid software engineering principles that are demonstrated with concrete examples using an open source tool chain.\n\nModels don’t deliver enough value if they are not on a direct path to code production. But to waste time building models that are merely pictures of your code doesn’t add much value either. In this book, you’ll translate detailed, yet platform-independent models that solve real application problems.\n\nUsing a pragmatic approach, Models to Code quickly dives into two case studies of Executable UML models. The models and code are extensively annotated and illustrate key principles that are emphasized throughout the book.\n\nYou’ll work with code production using “C” as the implementation language and targeting microcomputer class processors. This might not be your particular target language or platform, but you can use you can use what you learn here to engineer or re-evaluate your own code translation system to dramatically increase the value of both your modeling and code generation solution.\n\nWritten by three leading experts, Models to Code is an exceptional resource for producing software by model translation― add it to your library today.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nSee how detailed models resolve ambiguity and contradiction common in requirements.\nExamine how a model can be detailed enough to be executable and testable while remaining platform independent\nProduce code from a model, leaving the model intact so it can be redeployed on new platforms or adapted to changing software and hardware technology.\nImplement platform independent model execution rules in platform specific run-time code\nWho This Book Is For\n\nModelers and systems engineers on active MBSE projects (using Executable UML or not), projects using Simulink, Matlab, Dymola, MatrixX and other math modelling tools.\n\nAny developers with current or past model experience, professors, students, systems engineers, embedded systems developers, or anyone interested in learning more about software modelling.",

    "description": "Book Description:\n\nLearn how to write object-oriented programs in R and how to construct classes and class hierarchies in the three object-oriented systems available in R. This book gives an introduction to object-oriented programming in the R programming language and shows you how to use and apply R in an object-oriented manner. You will then be able to use this powerful programming style in your own statistical programming projects to write flexible and extendable software.\nAfter reading Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in R, you’ll come away with a practical project that you can reuse in your own analytics coding endeavors. You’ll then be able to visualize your data as objects that have state and then manipulate those objects with polymorphic or generic methods. Your projects will benefit from the high degree of flexibility provided by polymorphism, where the choice of concrete method to execute depends on the type of data being manipulated.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nDefine and use classes and generic functions using R\nWork with the R class hierarchies\nBenefit from implementation reuse\nHandle operator overloading\nApply the S4 and R6 classes\nWho This Book Is For\nExperienced programmers and for those with at least some prior experience with R programming language.",

    "description": "Book Description:\n\nProcedural generation is a growing trend in game development. It allows developers to create games that are bigger and more dynamic, giving the games a higher level of replayability. Procedural generation isn’t just one technique, it’s a collection of techniques and approaches that are used together to create dynamic systems and objects. C++ is the industry-standard programming language to write computer games. It’s at the heart of most engines, and is incredibly powerful. SFML is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, and open-source multimedia library. Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.\n\nUsing C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.\n\nThroughout the course of this book, we’ll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We’ll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.\n\nBy the end of the book, not only will you have a solid understanding of procedural generation, but you’ll also have a working roguelike game that you will have extended using the examples provided.",

With the superb memory management and the full integration with multi-node big data platforms, the H2O engine has become more and more popular among data scientists in the field of deep learning.\n\nThis book will introduce you to the deep learning package H2O with R and help you understand the concepts of deep learning. We will start by setting up important deep learning packages available in R and then move towards building models related to neural networks, prediction, and deep prediction, all of this with the help of real-life examples.\n\nAfter installing the H2O package, you will learn about prediction algorithms. Moving ahead, concepts such as overfitting data, anomalous data, and deep prediction models are explained. Finally, the book will cover concepts relating to tuning and optimizing models.\n\nWhat you will learn\n\nSet up the R package H2O to train deep learning models\nUnderstand the core concepts behind deep learning models\nUse Autoencoders to identify anomalous data or outliers\nPredict or classify data automatically using deep neural networks\nBuild generalizable models using regularization to avoid overfitting the training data",
